The optional Worker issues one-hour TURN credentials. It stores no rooms, profiles, or media. Its API token stays in Cloudflare's secret storage. The Electron build contains only the HTTPS endpoint.

To set up your own deployment, run from this directory:

```sh
npx wrangler secret put TURN_KEY_ID
npx wrangler secret put TURN_API_TOKEN
npx wrangler deploy
```

Set `config/turn.json` to `{"endpoint":"https://YOUR-WORKER.workers.dev/credentials"}` before building. Configure a unique rate-limit namespace for your account if `71004` is already in use. The broker denies issuance if its rate-limit binding is missing. It allows ten requests per minute per client IP; the desktop caches and renews credentials before expiry. [Cloudflare documents the rate-limit binding and its per-location scope](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/rate-limit/).

This is an anonymous service: anyone who knows the endpoint can request expiring credentials subject to that limit. Rate limiting is not an account-wide spending cap. Monitor TURN usage and add authenticated access at this endpoint if distributing beyond a small group. Do not put a shared secret in the desktop to identify legitimate installs. [Cloudflare's credential guidance](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/turn/generate-credentials/).

For a private local relay, put `{"iceServers":[{"urls":"turn:YOUR-HOST:3478","username":"YOUR-USER","credential":"YOUR-CREDENTIAL"}]}` in the application's user-data `turn.json`. Static credentials are never accepted by the packaging hook. Development can also load that local configuration from `config/turn.json`, but the build rejects it.

No deployment is created by building or testing this repository. If a previous installer shipped a Cloudflare minting token, revoke it separately; changing the code cannot revoke installed copies.
